## How the System Works

### 1. User Workflow
1. User selects Block 2 from the dashboard
2. Sees all 6 subcomponents with their current scores
3. Clicks on a subcomponent (e.g., "Interview Cadence")
4. Navigates to the subcomponent detail page

### 2. On Subcomponent Page
1. **Education Tab:** Learn about the concept and best practices
2. **Workspace Tab:** Fill out the worksheet with 6 questions
3. **Analysis Tab:** View AI-generated analysis and recommendations
4. **Resources Tab:** Access templates and tools
5. **Score History Tab:** Track progress over time

### 3. Analysis Process
When user clicks "Analyze Results":
1. Worksheet data is collected
2. Sent to `/api/analyze/customer-insights` endpoint
3. Routed to the appropriate agent based on subcomponent ID
4. Agent evaluates across 5 dimensions (20% weight each)
5. Returns score, detailed feedback, and recommendations

### 4. Scoring Methodology
Each agent evaluates 5 dimensions:
- **Dimension 1:** Completeness (20%)
- **Dimension 2:** Quality (20%)
- **Dimension 3:** Validation (20%)
- **Dimension 4:** Actionability (20%)
- **Dimension 5:** Strategic Alignment (20%)

Total score = Sum of all dimensions (0-100%)

### 5. Data Storage
- Analysis results automatically saved to Score History
- Uses localStorage with retry logic (3 attempts)
- Standardized display format across all modules
- Full analysis data preserved for later review

## Expected Behavior

### When Block 2 is Selected:
1. **Visual:** Orange-themed interface with ScaleOps6 branding
2. **Display:** Grid of 6 subcomponent cards
3. **Scores:** Shows current score or "--" if not analyzed
4. **Progress:** Orange gradient progress bars

### When Analyzing a Subcomponent:
1. **Loading State:** "Analyzing Your Customer Insights..."
2. **Results Display:** 
   - Overall score with color coding
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed dimension scores with progress bars
   - Strengths and areas for improvement
   - Strategic recommendations with priority badges
3. **Auto-Save:** Results saved to Score History
4. **Notifications:** Success messages for saving
