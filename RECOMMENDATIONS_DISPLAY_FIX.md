## üéØ KEY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### Unified Recommendations Format
```javascript
// All recommendations now follow this structure:
{
    priority: "HIGH",              // CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM
    action: "Clear action item",   // What to do
    expectedImprovement: "+8 points",  // ALWAYS in "+X points" format
    impact: "Specific benefit",    // Why it matters
    implementationPlan: [...]      // How to do it
}
```

### Display Enhancements
1. **Priority Badges**: Color-coded badges (CRITICAL=Red, HIGH=Orange, MEDIUM=Yellow)
2. **Impact Scores**: Always shown as "+X points" in green
3. **Expandable Cards**: Click for detailed implementation guidance
4. **Professional Layout**: Consistent with Problem Statement's rich format

### Technical Architecture
- **Centralized Library**: `recommendations-library-dynamic.js` (class-based)
- **Wrapper Function**: `recommendations-library-dynamic-wrapper.js` (provides function interface)
- **Enhanced Display**: `enhanced-analysis-display.js` (ensures proper rendering)
- **Unified Handler**: `unified-analysis-handler.js` (routes to appropriate agent)

15. `subcomponent-detail.html` - Updated to include enhanced display handler

### Server Configuration:
- Auto-reload enabled for development
- All agents properly registered in unified handler
- Dynamic recommendations library accessible to all agents

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### When User Analyzes a Worksheet:
1. Agent processes responses and generates score
2. Recommendations generated with "+X points" format
3. Analysis saved to localStorage
4. Analysis tab automatically opens
5. Recommendations display with:
   - Priority badges (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
   - Impact shown as "+X points" in green
   - Professional card layout with hover effects
   - Click to expand for implementation details

### Impact Calculation Logic:
- CRITICAL priority: +10-15 points
- HIGH priority: +6-9 points  
- MEDIUM priority: +3-5 points
- Based on current score and improvement potential
- Never shows percentages or timeframes

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Recommendations Don't Display:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage has saved analysis
3. Ensure enhanced display handler is loaded
4. Check that agent is using wrapper function

### If Format is Wrong:
1. Verify agent imports `recommendations-library-dynamic-wrapper.js`
2. Check that expectedImprovement uses "+X points" format
3. Ensure no timeframe fields are included
4. Verify priority is set to CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM

### Console Commands for Debugging:
```javascript
// Check saved analysis
localStorage.getItem('analysis_3-1')

// Manually trigger display
window.displayAnalysisResults(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('analysis_3-1')))

// Check if enhanced handler is loaded
console.log(typeof window.displayAnalysisResults)
```

## ‚ú® SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ Every recommendation shows "+X points" format
‚úÖ Priority badges appear on all recommendation cards
‚úÖ No timeframes mentioned anywhere
