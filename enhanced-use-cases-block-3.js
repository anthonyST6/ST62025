                challenge: "In 2014, Slack had 50+ feature requests from early customers but limited engineering resources. Stewart Butterfield needed systematic way to prioritize which use cases would drive adoption and retention. The challenge: create scoring framework that balanced customer demand, strategic value, and technical feasibility to guide product roadmap decisions worth millions in engineering investment.",
                
                approach: "Developed use case scoring matrix with four dimensions: customer demand (survey 100+ customers), strategic alignment (does it support core mission), revenue impact (will customers pay more), and technical complexity (engineering estimate). Scored each use case 1-10 on each dimension. Weighted scores: demand 30%, strategy 30%, revenue 25%, complexity 15%. Prioritized top 20% for immediate development. Re-scored quarterly as market evolved.",
                
                definition: "Great Use Case Scoring means systematic evaluation across multiple dimensions with clear weighting. Slack's framework scored customer demand (30%), strategic alignment (30%), revenue impact (25%), and technical complexity (15%). This prevented building features customers wanted but didn't align with strategy, or strategic features customers wouldn't use.",
                
                results: "Achieved $27B valuation (Salesforce acquisition), 12M+ daily active users. Scoring framework led to prioritizing search (high demand, strategic), integrations (revenue driver), and channels (core to mission) over requested features like video calls (initially low score). Framework enabled saying 'no' to 80% of requests while maintaining 90%+ customer satisfaction. Disciplined prioritization created focused product.",
                
                keyInsight: "Slack's scoring framework prevented building everything customers requested by weighing strategic alignment and revenue impact equally with demand. They said 'no' to 80% of requests systematically. For your use case scoring: weight multiple dimensions, not just customer demand. Systematic scoring enables confident 'no' decisions that protect product focus."

Elon Musk needed to score which use case to pursue first with limited capital. The challenge: evaluate use cases that required $100M+ investment each, balancing market size, technical feasibility, and strategic positioning for electric vehicle adoption.",
                
                approach: "Scored use cases on five dimensions: market validation (will people buy EVs), margin potential (can we be profitable), technology proof (can we build it), brand building (does it change perception), and scale path (does it lead to mass market). Roadster scored highest on validation and brand despite smallest market. Model S scored highest on margin and scale path. Sequenced: Roadster first (prove concept), Model S second (prove profitability), Model 3 third (scale).",
                
                definition: "Great Use Case Scoring means sequencing use cases strategically, not just picking the biggest market. Tesla scored Roadster highest initially despite smallest market because it validated technology and built brand necessary for later use cases. Sequential scoring created path from niche to mass market.",

Use case sequencing proved critical: Roadster validated EVs could be desirable (2008), Model S proved profitability (2012), Model 3 achieved scale (2017). Each use case built foundation for next. Sequential scoring enabled $100B+ company from $100M initial capital.",
                
                keyInsight: "Tesla scored use cases sequentially, not in isolation. Roadster's value wasn't market size but enabling Model S and Model 3. For your use case scoring: consider how use cases build on each other. Sequential value often exceeds individual use case value. Score for strategic sequencing, not just standalone merit."

                approach: "Scored use cases on four dimensions: developer pain (how acute is need), technical feasibility (can we build it reliably), strategic foundation (does it enable other services), and market education (how much teaching required). Storage (S3) and compute (EC2) scored highest on pain and foundation despite high complexity. Messaging (SQS) scored high on feasibility. Launched these three first, then scored next wave based on customer usage patterns.",
                
                definition: "Great Use Case Scoring means identifying foundational use cases that enable ecosystem. AWS scored storage and compute highest not because they were easiest but because they were foundational—every other service would build on them. Foundation-first scoring created platform, not point solutions.",
                
                results: "AWS grew to $80B+ annual revenue, 32% market share. Foundational use case prioritization proved critical: S3 and EC2 enabled 200+ subsequent services. Customers who adopted foundational services (scored first) had 10x higher lifetime value than those who started with specialized services. Foundation-first scoring created $80B platform from initial 3 services.",
                
                keyInsight: "AWS scored foundational use cases highest even though they were hardest to build. They prioritized services that enabled ecosystem over easy wins.

Patrick Collison needed to score which use cases to build next after core payments. The challenge: prioritize use cases that would increase revenue per customer while maintaining developer-first simplicity that made Stripe successful.",
                
                approach: "Scored use cases on five dimensions: customer request frequency (how many asking), revenue expansion (increase ARPU), technical leverage (reuse existing infrastructure), competitive differentiation (unique capability), and complexity burden (does it complicate core product). Subscriptions scored highest on requests and revenue. Marketplaces scored highest on differentiation. Fraud prevention scored highest on leverage. Built in that sequence.",
                
                definition: "Great Use Case Scoring means balancing revenue expansion with product simplicity. Stripe scored subscriptions highest because it increased ARPU without complicating core payments API. They avoided use cases that would have generated revenue but complicated developer experience, protecting their key differentiator.",
                
                results: "Achieved $95B valuation, processes $640B+ annually. Use case prioritization drove expansion: subscriptions increased ARPU 3x, marketplaces enabled platforms like Shopify and Lyft, fraud prevention became competitive moat. Disciplined scoring maintained developer experience—integration still takes hours despite 100+ features. Revenue per customer grew 10x through scored use case expansion.",
                
                keyInsight: "Stripe scored use cases on revenue expansion AND complexity burden, avoiding features that would complicate their core differentiator (simplicity). For your use case scoring: include 'complexity cost' as dimension. High-revenue use cases that complicate your differentiator may destroy more value than they create."

Ivan Zhao faced choice: build enterprise features (permissions, SSO, admin controls) or improve core product. The challenge: score use cases that would enable enterprise sales without alienating individual users who loved Notion's simplicity.",
                
                approach: "Scored use cases on four dimensions: enterprise requirement (blocker for sales), individual user impact (does it complicate experience), technical investment (engineering months), and strategic positioning (does it enable new market). Enterprise features scored high on requirement and positioning but low on individual impact. Created separate scoring for 'must-have' (blockers) vs 'nice-to-have' (enhancements). Prioritized must-haves that didn't impact individuals.",

Notion scored enterprise use cases on whether they were sales blockers (must-have) vs enhancements (nice-to-have), and whether they impacted individual users. This prevented over-building enterprise features that would complicate product for individuals.",
                
                results: "Achieved $10B valuation, 30M+ users. Enterprise use case scoring enabled expansion: built SSO, permissions, and admin controls (sales blockers) without complicating individual experience. Enterprise revenue grew from $0 to $100M+ while maintaining individual user growth. Disciplined scoring prevented enterprise feature bloat that kills many products.",
                
                keyInsight: "Notion used separate scoring frameworks for enterprise vs individual use cases, preventing enterprise features from complicating individual experience. For your use case scoring: segment by customer type and score differently. Enterprise use cases should be scored on 'is it a blocker' not 'is it nice to have.'"

                results: "Achieved $20B valuation (Adobe acquisition), 4M+ users. Defensibility-focused scoring proved critical: collaboration features (scored for moat) became competitive advantage Adobe couldn't replicate. Prototyping and handoff (scored for workflow completion) kept users in Figma. Plugin ecosystem (scored for moat) created switching costs. Scoring for defensibility enabled competing against $200B Adobe.",
