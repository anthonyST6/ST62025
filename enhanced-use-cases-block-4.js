                challenge: "In 2007, Drew Houston needed to validate that people would use cloud storage before building complex sync technology. Existing solutions (email attachments, USB drives) were painful but familiar. The challenge: define minimum viable product that proved people wanted cloud storage without building full infrastructure, risking months of development on unvalidated idea.",
                
                approach: "Created 3-minute demo video showing Dropbox concept without building product. Posted video on Hacker News and Digg. Measured validation: beta waitlist signups. Video generated 75,000 signups overnight—validating demand before writing sync code. Built actual MVP with core feature only: file sync across devices. No sharing, no mobile, no collaboration. Launched to waitlist, measured retention and usage patterns.",
                
                definition: "Great MVP Definition means validating demand before building, then building minimum feature set that proves core value. Dropbox's video MVP validated demand (75K signups), then product MVP proved sync worked (file sync only, no sharing). Two-stage validation reduced risk before major investment.",
                
                results: "Achieved $10B valuation, 700M+ users. MVP approach proved critical: video validated demand with zero development, product MVP proved sync technology worked. Staged validation enabled raising $1.2M seed round before building full product. MVP discipline prevented building features (sharing, mobile) before proving core value (sync).",
                
                keyInsight: "Dropbox validated demand with video before building product, then built product MVP with one feature (sync). They validated twice before scaling. For your MVP: validate demand before building (landing page, video, prototype), then build minimum feature set that proves core value. Two-stage validation reduces risk."

The challenge: define MVP that tested core assumption (trust between strangers) without building payments, reviews, or search infrastructure that would take months.",
                
                approach: "Created simple website with photos of their apartment during sold-out conference. No payments (cash only), no reviews (trust based on meeting), no search (just their listing). Validated core assumption: 3 people paid $80/night to stay with strangers. Built marketplace MVP after validation: added multiple listings, basic search, and PayPal payments. Still no reviews, no professional photos, no insurance.",

Airbnb's MVP tested trust (will people stay with strangers) with one listing and cash payments. They validated riskiest assumption before building marketplace features. Assumption-first MVP reduced risk.",
                
                results: "Achieved $75B peak valuation, 150M+ users globally. MVP approach proved critical: single listing validated trust assumption, enabling marketplace build. Testing riskiest assumption first (trust) prevented building marketplace that nobody would use. Assumption-first MVP enabled building on validated foundation.",
                
                keyInsight: "Airbnb tested riskiest assumption (trust) with one listing before building marketplace. They validated assumption before building features. For your MVP: identify riskiest assumption and test it with absolute minimum. Don't build features until core assumption is validated."

                approach: "Created website with photos of shoes from local stores. When customer ordered, bought shoes from store and shipped them. No inventory, no warehouse, no logistics. Validated demand: customers bought shoes online despite not trying them on. Measured return rates and customer satisfaction. After validation, built inventory and warehouse infrastructure. MVP proved demand before capital investment.",
                
                definition: "Great MVP Definition means manual operations that don't scale to validate demand before automation. Zappos manually bought and shipped shoes (didn't scale) to validate demand before building warehouse. Manual MVP proved demand before infrastructure investment.",
                
                results: "Achieved $1.2B acquisition by Amazon, pioneered online shoe retail. MVP approach proved critical: manual operations validated demand without capital investment. Proof of demand enabled raising capital for warehouse and inventory. Manual-first MVP prevented building infrastructure for market that might not exist.",
                
                keyInsight: "Zappos manually fulfilled orders (didn't scale) to validate demand before building warehouse. They proved demand before infrastructure. For your MVP: do things manually that don't scale to validate demand. Automation comes after validation, not before."

                approach: "Stripped Burbn down to core photo features: take photo, apply filter, share. Removed location, plans, and all other features. Built iOS-only MVP in 8 weeks. No Android, no web, no messaging, no stories. Validated concept: 25K signups on launch day, users sharing 100+ photos per day. Measured engagement and retention before adding features.",
