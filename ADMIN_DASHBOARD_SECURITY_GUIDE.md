## üìã Security Overview

### Security Layers
1. **Authentication** - Verify user identity
2. **Authorization** - Control access to resources
3. **Data Protection** - Secure sensitive information
4. **Audit Logging** - Track all admin actions
5. **Network Security** - Protect against attacks

## ‚úÖ Authentication Security

### Firebase Authentication ‚úÖ
- [x] Firebase Admin SDK configured
- [x] Service account credentials secured
- [x] Login page with real credentials
- [x] Signup page with real credentials
- [x] Token verification middleware created

### To Implement for Production ‚è≥
- [ ] Apply `verifyFirebaseToken` to all admin routes
- [ ] Add token expiration handling
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Add session timeout (30 minutes)
- [ ] Implement "remember me" functionality
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Log all authentication attempts
- [ ] Rate limit login attempts (5 per minute)

### Authentication Testing Checklist
- [ ] Valid credentials allow access
- [ ] Invalid credentials rejected
- [ ] Expired tokens handled gracefully
- [ ] Token refresh works correctly
- [ ] Logout clears all credentials
- [ ] Session timeout works
- [ ] Brute force protection active
- [ ] MFA works (if implemented)

```
admin        - Full access to admin dashboard
user         - Standard user access (no admin)
vc           - VC-specific features (no admin)
st6_partner  - Partner features (no admin)
```

#### Access Control Matrix
| Resource | admin | user | vc | st6_partner |
|----------|-------|------|----|----|
| /admin | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| View all users | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Modify users | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Assign VCs | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| View analytics | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Access billing | ‚úÖ | Self only | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### To Implement for Production ‚è≥
- [ ] Add `requireRole('admin')` to all admin routes
- [ ] Implement frontend route guards
- [ ] Add role checking in UI (hide unauthorized features)
- [ ] Log all authorization failures
- [ ] Implement privilege escalation detection
- [ ] Add IP-based access restrictions (optional)
- [ ] Implement time-based access controls (optional)

### Authorization Testing Checklist
- [ ] Admin role can access all features
- [ ] User role cannot access admin dashboard
- [ ] VC role cannot access admin dashboard
- [ ] ST6 Partner role cannot access admin dashboard
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts logged
- [ ] Privilege escalation attempts blocked
- [ ] Frontend hides unauthorized features

## üåê Network Security

### CORS Configuration ‚úÖ
- [x] CORS headers configured
- [x] Allow specific origins (currently *)

### To Harden for Production ‚è≥
- [ ] Restrict CORS to specific domains

- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Implement security headers:
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - [ ] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - [ ] Strict-Transport-Security

2. **Contain** - Disable affected accounts/features
3. **Investigate** - Review audit logs
4. **Remediate** - Fix vulnerability
5. **Document** - Record incident details
6. **Notify** - Inform affected users (if required)

## üìù Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Use strong passwords** - 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
2. **Enable MFA** - Add second factor authentication
3. **Limit admin accounts** - Only create when necessary
4. **Review audit logs** - Check weekly for suspicious activity
5. **Keep credentials secure** - Never share or commit to git
6. **Use HTTPS** - Always access over secure connection
7. **Log out when done** - Don't leave sessions open
8. **Update regularly** - Keep dependencies current

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Trust nothing from users
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
4. **Sanitize outputs** - Prevent XSS
5. **Implement CSRF protection** - Validate all state-changing requests
6. **Log security events** - Track all suspicious activity
7. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run npm audit regularly
8. **Review code** - Peer review all security-related changes
