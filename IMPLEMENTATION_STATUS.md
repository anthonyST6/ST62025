# ScaleOps6 Platform - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED: Structure Locking System

### What Was Locked
The user confirmed these elements are PERFECT and must be locked:
1. **Main Page Structure** - Dashboard with 16 blocks
2. **Mission Discovery Block** - Structure and navigation
3. **Problem Statement Subcomponent** - Complete structure including:
   - 5 tabs (Education, Workspace, Analysis, Resources, Score History)
   - Agent integration format
   - Scoring engine (5 dimensions × 20 points)
   - Interactive worksheet (6 fields)
   - Visual theme (black background, orange accents)

### Locking Implementation
1. **template-config.js** - Deep-frozen configuration preventing structural changes
2. **component-factory.js** - Factory pattern ensuring all components follow locked structure
3. **LOCKED_STRUCTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Comprehensive guide with "STRUCTURE IS SACRED - CONTENT IS FLEXIBLE" principle

## ✅ COMPLETED: Content Libraries

### 1. Agent Library (agent-library.js)
- **96 Expert Agents Created** - One for each subcomponent
- Each agent includes:
  - Unique name and description
  - 5 scoring dimensions with weights
  - Evaluation criteria for score ranges
  - Specialized expertise area

### 2. Worksheet Library (worksheet-library.js)
- **96 Customized Worksheets Created** - Aligned with agent scoring
- Each worksheet includes:
  - 6 fields (locked count, customizable labels)
  - Field labels match agent scoring dimensions
  - Appropriate input types (textarea/input)
  - Required and optional fields

### 3. Scoring Engine (scoring-engine.js)
- **Universal Scoring System** - Works with all 96 agents
- Features:
  - Dimension-based scoring (5 × 20 points = 100 total)
  - Content analysis and keyword matching
  - Evaluation based on score ranges
  - Recommendation generation
  - Score history tracking
  - Benchmarking capabilities
  - Action plan generation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Generate Block Pages** (16 total)
   - Use locked structure from template-config.js
   - List 6 subcomponents per block
   - Maintain navigation consistency

2. **Generate Subcomponent Pages** (95 remaining)
   - Use component-factory.js for consistency
   - Integrate agents from agent-library.js
   - Apply worksheets from worksheet-library.js
   - Connect scoring-engine.js

3. **Update Navigation System**
   - Main dashboard → 16 blocks
   - Each block → 6 subcomponents
   - Breadcrumb navigation throughout

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify all components work together
   - Test scoring calculations
   - Validate data persistence
   - Check navigation flow

## 🔒 Critical Rules (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. **Structure is LOCKED** - No changes to:
   - Tab structure (5 tabs)
   - Worksheet field count (6 fields)
   - Scoring system (5 dimensions × 20 points)
   - Visual theme (black/orange)

2. **Content is FLEXIBLE** - Can customize:
   - Agent names and scoring logic
   - Worksheet field labels and placeholders
   - Educational content
   - Resource links

3. **Use Factory Pattern** - All new components MUST use:
   ```javascript
   const factory = new ComponentFactory();
   const newComponent = factory.createSubcomponent(blockId, subId, customContent);
   ```
