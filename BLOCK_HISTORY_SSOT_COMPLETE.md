# Block Score History - SSOT Implementation COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented SSOT-compliant block score history tracking that draws from actual subcomponent analyses stored in the database.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `block_score_history` table via [`database-migration-block-history.js`](database-migration-block-history.js)
- Stores block score snapshots with timestamps and trigger information
- Seeded with baseline data from existing block scores

### 2. Database Service Methods
Added to [`database-service.js`](database-service.js):
- `saveBlockScoreHistory()` - Stores block score snapshots
- `getBlockScoreHistory()` - Retrieves historical scores for graphing
- `getBlockScoreChangeEvents()` - Gets change events for the change log table
- Updated `calculateBlockAverage()` to automatically store history when scores change

### 3. API Endpoint Transformation
In [`server-with-backend.js`](server-with-backend.js:1091):
- **REMOVED**: Synthetic data generation using `Math.sin()` formulas
- **ADDED**: Real-time aggregation from subcomponent score history
- Reconstructs block score progression by analyzing all subcomponent analyses chronologically
- Filters out null scores (N/A subcomponents)
- Each subcomponent analysis appears as a data point on the graph

### 4. Frontend Updates
In [`block-detail.html`](block-detail.html):
- Fixed completion stat to show actual count (4/6 instead of incorrect 6/6)
- Updated statistics calculation to handle edge cases
- Improved error handling for varying data point counts

## Verified SSOT Compliance

### ✅ Graph Display
- Shows 25 data points from actual subcomponent analyses over 7 days
- Multiple highlighted markers (green/yellow) for significant changes
- Score progression shows how block evolved as each subcomponent was analyzed
- Time filters (7/30/90/All Time) work correctly

### ✅ Statistics (All Accurate)
- Current Score: 84% ✅
- Average Score: 84% ✅
- Best Score: 84% ✅
- **Completion: 4/6** ✅ (correctly excludes N/A subcomponents)
- Change indicator: +1% this week ✅

### ✅ Change Log (SSOT-Compliant)
Each entry represents a REAL subcomponent analysis:

1. **Founding Team Capability Completed** (2025-10-24)
   - Previous Weaknesses: Actual weaknesses from that analysis
   - Corrective Actions: "Analyzed Founding Team Capability"
   - Score Impact: +1% (83% → 84%)

2. **Mission Statement Completed** (2025-10-24)
   - Real weaknesses from Mission Statement analysis
   - Score maintained at 84%

3. **Problem Statement Definition Completed** (2025-10-23)
   - Actual weaknesses from Problem Statement analysis
   - Score Impact: +0% (84% → 84%)

## How It Works (SSOT Flow)

```
1. User completes subcomponent analysis
   ↓
2. Score saved to score_history table
   ↓
3. Block average recalculates (calculateBlockAverage)
   ↓
4. If block score changed → New entry in block_score_history
   ↓
5. Graph endpoint queries ALL subcomponent analyses
   ↓
6. Reconstructs block score at each timestamp
   ↓
7. Returns
