      chorus: {
        challenge: "Chorus's conversation intelligence platform captured calls, but insights weren't effectively translated into actionable improvements. While analysis identified patterns, there was no systematic process to ensure findings drove changes in sales approach or training. Without closed-loop improvement processes, call analysis generated insights that didn't translate to performance improvements, limiting the ROI of conversation intelligence.",
        approach: "Chorus built a Closed-Loop Call Intelligence System that systematically translated insights into improvements. They created action planning processes that assigned ownership for addressing identified issues. The system tracked improvement initiatives and measured their impact on subsequent call quality and outcomes. They implemented feedback loops where sales leaders reported on actions taken based on call insights. Analytics measured which improvements most effectively addressed identified weaknesses. Regular reviews ensured accountability for acting on insights.",

        challenge: "Clari's revenue platform captured calls, but call insights weren't effectively integrated into deal forecasting and pipeline management. While call analysis provided valuable signals about deal health, these insights remained separate from forecasting processes. Without integration of call intelligence into revenue operations, the company couldn't leverage conversation insights for more accurate forecasting and proactive deal management.",
        approach: "Clari developed an Integrated Call Intelligence System that connected conversation insights to revenue operations. They analyzed calls to extract deal health signals: engagement levels, stakeholder sentiment, competitive mentions, and timeline indicators. The system integrated these signals into deal scoring and forecasting models. They created automated alerts when call analysis indicated deal risks or opportunities. Analytics measured how call-based signals improved forecast accuracy and enabled proactive deal management.",
