## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Recommendations Library
All agents now import and use:
```javascript
const { generateDynamicRecommendations } = require('./recommendations-library-dynamic');
```

### 2. Impact Format Standardization
All recommendations now show impact as:
```javascript
impact: `+${points} points`
```
Never as percentages or other formats.

### 3. No Timeframes Policy
Removed all references to:
- "X days/weeks/months to complete"
- "Completion timeframe"
- "Estimated duration"
- Any specific time commitments

### 4. Actionable Recommendations
All recommendations focus on actions, not resources:
- ❌ "Use this template"
- ✅ "Create structured approach"
- ❌ "Download framework"
- ✅ "Implement systematic methodology"

### 5. Unified URL Structure
All blocks use consistent URL format:
- Blocks: `block-detail.html?id=X`
- Subcomponents: `subcomponent-detail.html?id=X-Y`

---

## Testing Checklist
