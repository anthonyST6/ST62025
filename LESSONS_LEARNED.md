# ScaleOps6 Platform - Lessons Learned

## Date: September 23, 2025

### Critical Infrastructure Issues Discovered

#### 1. Agent Field Mapping Misalignment
**Problem:** Multiple agents were incorrectly mapping worksheet fields to their evaluation logic, causing severe scoring issues.

**Example:** Prototype Launch agent (subcomponent 4-6) was expecting:
- Field 1: MVP scope → Actually: Launch success definition
- Field 2: Timeline → Actually: Usage metrics  
- Field 3: Resources → Actually: Quality metrics
- Field 4: Testing → Actually: Business metrics
- Field 5: General metrics → Actually: Tracking methods
- Field 6: Risks → Actually: Pivot triggers

**Impact:** 
- Scores as low as 19% for comprehensive, high-quality answers
- Recommendations showing "undefined" values
- User frustration and loss of trust in the platform

**Root Cause:** 
- Agents were built with assumptions about worksheet questions
- No validation between agent expectations and actual worksheet content
- Copy-paste development without proper adaptation

#### 2. Routing Architecture Issues
**Problem:** Multiple blocks were incorrectly routing to the wrong agents.

**Examples:**
- Blocks 1-3 were ALL using Problem Statement agent
- Block 4 subcomponents were using wrong specialized agents
- No proper block-level routing endpoints

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created block-level endpoints (`/api/analyze/mission-discovery`, etc.)
- Each endpoint internally routes to appropriate agent based on subcomponent ID
- Centralized routing logic in server.js

#### 3. Display Rendering Issues
**Problem:** Analysis results weren't displaying even when data was successfully received.

**Root Cause:** 
- Mismatch between data structure expected by display handler and actual API response
- localStorage key conflicts
- Timing issues with async operations

### Action Items for Post-Infrastructure Completion

#### CRITICAL: Comprehensive Agent Audit Required
After main infrastructure is complete, we need to:

1. **Validate ALL 48 agents** for:
   - Correct field mapping to actual worksheet questions
   - Proper scoring logic that matches the questions asked
   - Recommendation generation using dynamic library
   - Appropriate scoring thresholds (not too harsh, not too lenient)

2. **Test each agent with:**
   - Empty responses (should score 0-10%)
   - Minimal responses (should score 20-40%)
   - Good responses (should score 60-80%)
   - Excellent responses (should score 80-95%)

3. **Verify routing for all blocks:**
   - Each block uses correct endpoint
   - Each subcomponent routes to correct agent
   - No defaulting to wrong agents

4. **Ensure display consistency:**
   - All recommendations show "+X points" format
   - Priority badges (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) display correctly
   - Rich formatting with cards and visual hierarchy
   - No "undefined" values in output

### Technical Debt to Address

1. **Agent Base Class:** Create a base agent class to ensure consistency
2. **Field Mapping Configuration:** Centralize field mappings in configuration
3. **Automated Testing:** Build test suite for agent scoring logic
4. **Validation Layer:** Add validation between worksheets and agents
5. **Monitoring:** Add logging to detect scoring anomalies

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always verify field mapping** when creating new agents
2. **Test with actual worksheet data** not assumed data
3. **Use the dynamic recommendations library** for all agents
4. **Maintain scoring consistency** across similar agents
5. **Document expected inputs and outputs** for each agent

### Estimated Effort for Full Audit

- Time Required: 2-3 days
- Resources: 1 developer + 1 QA tester
- Priority: CRITICAL - Must be done before production release

### Success Metrics

After audit completion:
- All agents score within expected ranges
- No "undefined" values in recommendations
- Consistent scoring across similar question types
- User satisfaction with scoring fairness
- Clear, actionable recommendations with impact scores

## Notes

This issue pattern suggests systemic problems across the codebase. The fact that Prototype Launch agent had such severe misalignment indicates other agents likely have similar issues. A comprehensive audit is not optional - it's critical for platform credibility.

**Remember:** Users judge the entire platform based on individual interactions. One badly scoring agent can destroy trust in the entire system.
