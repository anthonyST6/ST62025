## Key Principles Applied

### 1. Unified URL Structure
All Customer Insights subcomponents now use the standardized URL format:
```
subcomponent-detail.html?id=2-X
```
Where X is the subcomponent number (1-6)

### 2. Dynamic Recommendations
All agents now import the dynamic recommendations library:
```javascript
const { RecommendationsLibraryDynamic } = require('./recommendations-library-dynamic');
```

### 3. Impact Format
All recommendations use the "+X points" format:
```javascript
impact: `+${improvement} points`
```

### 4. No Timeframes
Removed any completion timeframe references. Frequency terms like "weekly" or "monthly" are kept when they describe meeting types or cadences, not completion times.

### 5. Actionable Recommendations
All recommendations provide specific actions, not generic resources:
```javascript
actionPlan: [
    'Set weekly or bi-weekly interview targets',
    'Block calendar time for customer conversations',
    'Create interview scheduling automation',
    'Track interview completion metrics'
]
```
