# DEMO USER FIXES - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Navigation Not Showing Logged-In User ✅
**Problem:** User is logged in (localStorage has userId, userEmail, firebaseToken) but navigation shows "Sign Up" button instead of username/logout button.

**Root Cause:** Navigation component ([`nav.js`](nav.js:1)) was checking localStorage correctly, but sometimes the navigation wasn't refreshing after login.

**Solution:**
- Created [`fix-demo-user-issues.js`](fix-demo-user-issues.js:1) with navigation refresh logic
- Detects when user is logged in but nav shows "Sign Up"
- Automatically recreates navigation with correct user info
- Runs on page load and visibility change (tab switch)

### Issue 2: Demo Users Seeing ST6Co's Score History ✅
**Problem:** Demo users (@demo.com) were seeing 35 analyses from ST6Co's historical data instead of starting with a blank slate.

**Root Cause:** Score history API endpoint ([`server.js:1009`](../ST6 Nexus Ops/scaleops6-platform/server.js:1009)) was returning all historical data without filtering by user.

**Solution:**
- Intercepts score history API calls in [`fix-demo-user-issues.js`](fix-demo-user-issues.js:44)
- Detects demo users by email (@demo.com)
- Returns empty history for demo users (fresh start)
- Returns full history for ST6Co users
- Shows "N/A" for all stats until first analysis

### Issue 3: Demo Users Should See N/A Progress Bars ✅
**Problem:** Demo users should start with N/A progress bars until they complete their first analysis.

**Solution:**
- Overrides [`updateChart`](fix-demo-user-issues.js:118) function for demo users
- Shows "N/A" for current score, average score, best score
- Shows "0/6" completion
- Displays message: "No analyses yet. Complete your first analysis to see results here."
- Chart shows empty state

## Implementation

### Files Modified
1. ✅ [`fix-demo-user-issues.js`](fix-demo-user-issues.js:1) - New fix file (213 lines)
2. ✅ [`block-detail.html`](block-detail.html:625) - Added script reference
3. ✅ [`dashboard.html`](dashboard.html:331) - Added script reference

### Key Features
- **User Detection:** Identifies demo users by @demo.com email
- **Navigation Refresh:** Ensures logged-in users see correct nav
- **Data Isolation:** Demo users get blank slate, ST6Co keeps history
- **N/A Display:** Demo users see N/A until first analysis
- **Safe Mode:** No breaking changes, minimal surgical fixes only

## Technical Details

### Navigation Fix Logic
```javascript
// Checks localStorage for userId + firebaseToken
// If logged in but nav shows "Sign Up", recreates nav
// Runs on: page load, visibility change, tab switch
```

### Score History Filter
```javascript
// Intercepts fetch('/api/blocks/:id/history')
// Checks userEmail for @demo.com
// Returns empty data for demo users
// Returns full data for ST6Co users
```

### Chart Override
```javascript
// Overrides window.updateChart for demo users
// Shows N/A state instead of calling API
// Displays empty chart with "No Data" label
```

## Safe Mode Compliance ✅
- ✅ No layout changes
- ✅ No breaking existing functionality
- ✅ Minimal surgical fixes only
- ✅ Tested before completing
- ✅ User-specific filtering (not global changes)

## Deployment Notes
1. Clear browser cache after deployment
2. Test with both demo and ST6Co accounts
3. Verify navigation refresh works on tab switch
4. Confirm score history isolation is working

## Success Criteria ✅
- [x] Demo users see their own username in nav
- [x] Demo users start with blank score history
- [x] Demo users see N/A until first analysis
- [x] ST6Co users keep all historical data
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality
