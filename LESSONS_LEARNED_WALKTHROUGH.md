## 1. MISSION DISCOVERY MODULE OVERVIEW

### What Happens When Mission Discovery is Selected?

When a user clicks on **Mission Discovery (Block 1)** from the dashboard:

1. **Navigation Flow:**
   - User sees 6 sub-modules:
     - 1-1: Problem Statement
     - 1-2: Vision
     - 1-3: Mission
     - 1-4: Values
     - 1-5: Success Metrics
     - 1-6: Stakeholder Alignment

2. **Module Structure (Each has 5 tabs):**
   - 📚 **Education Tab**: Learning content about the concept
   - ✏️ **Workspace Tab**: Interactive worksheet with pre-filled sample data
   - 🤖 **Analysis Tab**: AI-powered analysis results
   - 🔧 **Resources Tab**: Templates, case studies, tools
   - 📊 **Score History Tab**: Progress tracking over time

### Expected Behavior:
```javascript
User Action: Click "Mission Discovery" → Select "Problem Statement"
System Response: Load module-1-1.html with all 5 tabs
Default View: Education tab (auto-loaded)
Pre-filled Data: Workspace has sample B2B SaaS startup data
Critical Fix: Analyze button now REDIRECTS to Analysis tab (no results below)
```

## 2. APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

### Agent Activation System

**96 Specialized Agents** (6 agents per block × 16 blocks):

```javascript
// Agent Structure
const agentMap = {
  'block-1': {
    'module-1': 'ProblemStatementAgent',
    'module-2': 'VisionAgent',
    'module-3': 'MissionAgent',
    'module-4': 'ValuesAgent',
    'module-5': 'SuccessMetricsAgent',
    'module-6': 'StakeholderAlignmentAgent'
  },
  // ... 15 more blocks with 6 agents each
}
```

### Which Agent is Activated?

When user clicks "Analyze Results" in module 1-1:
1. **ProblemStatementAgent** is activated
2. Agent evaluates 5 dimensions:
   - Purpose Clarity (0-20 points)
   - Vision Ambition (0-20 points)
   - Stakeholder Focus (0-20 points)
   - Value Alignment (0-20 points)
   - Measurability (0-20 points)

---

## 3. AGENT SYSTEM & TASK COMPLETION

### How the Agent Completes Tasks Step-by-Step:

```javascript
// Step 1: User submits workspace data
analyzeWorksheet() triggered

// Step 2: FORCE REDIRECT to Analysis tab (NEW FIX)
forceAnalyzeWithRedirect() → Hides all tabs, shows Analysis only

// Step 3: Agent Processing (1.5 seconds)
- Extract worksheet data from localStorage
- Apply scoring algorithm
- Generate insights based on patterns
- Create action recommendations

// Step 4: Display Comprehensive Results IN ANALYSIS TAB ONLY
displayComprehensiveResults() shows:
- Overall Score (69-99%)
- Executive Summary
- 5 Detailed Scoring Sections
- Strategic Recommendations (Critical/High/Medium priority)
- Implementation Summary
- Auto-save to Score History
```

### Agent Decision Logic:
```javascript
const agentLogic = {
  scoring: {
    excellent: score >= 18,  // "Well-quantified goals"
    good: score >= 15,       // "Clear articulation"
    needsWork: score < 15    // "Needs more specificity"
  },
  recommendations: {
    critical: impactPoints >= 5,  // Red badge
    high: impactPoints >= 4,      // Orange badge
    medium: impactPoints >= 3     // Green badge
  }
}
```

## 4. INPUT/OUTPUT FLOW

### EXPECTED INPUTS (Workspace Tab):

**Module 1-1 Problem Statement Fields:**
```
1. Who is Affected? → "B2B SaaS founders and GTM leaders..."
2. What is the Problem? → "Struggle to build effective GTM strategies..."
3. When Does it Occur? → "During critical growth phases..."
4. What is the Impact? → "Lose 6-12 months runway, $500K-$2M wasted..."
5. How Are They Solving it Today? → "Expensive consultants ($20-50K/month)..."
```

### EXPECTED OUTPUTS (Analysis Tab - REDIRECTED):

**Comprehensive Analysis Display:**
```
Overall Score: 75%
├── Executive Summary
├── Scoring Breakdown:

```

## 5. KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### Technical Discoveries:

1. **Handler Conflicts Resolution:**
   - Problem: Multiple event handlers causing "Display Error"
   - Solution: Single instance pattern with unified handlers
   ```javascript
   // BAD: Multiple handlers
   button.onclick = handler1;
   button.addEventListener('click', handler2);
   
   // GOOD: Single unified handler
   window.analyzeWorksheet = unifiedHandler;
   ```

2. **Redirect Issue Fix:**
   - Problem: Results showing below workspace instead of redirecting
   - Solution: Force redirect with tab hiding and button override
   ```javascript
   // ULTIMATE FIX: Force redirect
   function forceAnalyzeWithRedirect() {
     // Hide ALL tabs
     document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content').forEach(tab => {
       tab.classList.remove('active');
       tab.style.display = 'none';
     });
     // Show ONLY Analysis tab
     analysisTab.classList.add('active');
     analysisTab.style.display = 'block';
   }
   ```

3. **Data Persistence Issues:**
   - Problem: Score history not saving reliably
   - Solution: 3-attempt retry logic with fallback
   ```javascript
   function saveWithRetry(data, attempts = 3) {
     try {
       localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data));
     } catch(e) {
       if (attempts > 0) saveWithRetry(data, attempts - 1);
     }
   }
   ```

### UX Improvements:

1. **Pre-filled Sample Data:**
   - All workspace fields have realistic B2B SaaS examples
   - Users can analyze immediately without typing

2. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Loading animations during processing
   - Color-coded scores (Green >80%, Orange 60-80%, Red <60%)
   - Priority badges on recommendations

3. **Consistent Branding:**
   - ScaleOps6 orange (#FF5500) throughout
   - Dark theme (#000 background)
   - Uppercase headers with letter spacing
