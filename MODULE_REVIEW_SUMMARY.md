- Visual indicators show completion status

### 2. Worksheet Interaction
- User clicks on a subcomponent
- Educational content explains what, why, and how
- Interactive worksheet with 6 targeted questions
- Auto-save functionality preserves progress

### 3. AI Analysis Process
When user clicks "Analyze with AI":
1. Worksheet data sent to appropriate specialized agent
2. Agent evaluates across 5 dimensions (20% each):
   - Completeness
   - Clarity
   - Strategic Alignment
   - Evidence Quality
   - Actionability
3. Score calculated (0-100%)
4. Recommendations generated with impact scores

### 4. Results Display
**Standardized across ALL modules:**
- Overall score with visual gauge
- Dimension breakdown with progress bars
- Strengths section highlighting what's working
- Areas for Improvement with specific gaps
- Strategic Recommendations with:
  - Priority badges (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
  - Expected score impact (+X points)
  - Actionable next steps

### 5. Score History
- Every analysis automatically saved
- Full analysis viewable from history
- Trend tracking over time
- Export capabilities for reporting

## What Makes Each Agent Special

### Deterministic Scoring Logic
Each agent uses specific criteria relevant to its domain:
- **Problem Statement Agent**: Evaluates problem clarity, impact quantification, evidence
- **Mission Statement Agent**: Assesses vision clarity, value proposition, differentiation
- **Customer Insight Agent**: Measures depth of understanding, validation methods, insights quality
- **Founding Team Agent**: Evaluates skills coverage, experience relevance, commitment indicators
- **Market Insight Agent**: Analyzes market size accuracy, timing factors, competitive understanding
- **Prototype Launch Agent**: Reviews technical feasibility, testing approach, success metrics

### Consistent Yet Specialized
While all agents follow the same 5-dimension framework, each has:
- Custom evaluation criteria per dimension
- Domain-specific keyword detection
- Specialized recommendation libraries
- Industry-relevant benchmarks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Routing Architecture
```
User Action → Block Endpoint → Subcomponent Router → Specialized Agent → Analysis → Display
```

Example for Block 2:
- Endpoint: `/api/analyze/customer-insights`
- Router: Checks subcomponentId (2-1 through 2-6)
- Agent Selection: Routes to appropriate enhanced agent
- Processing: Agent analyzes worksheet data
- Storage: Saves to database and localStorage
- Display: Standardized UI renders results

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Worksheet responses (6 fields)
2. **Processing**: Agent evaluation and scoring
3. **Storage**: 
   - Database (scores, metadata)
   - LocalStorage (full analysis for history)
   - Activity log (audit trail)
4. **Output**: Standardized analysis display

## Quality Assurance Checklist
