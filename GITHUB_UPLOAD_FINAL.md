# Final GitHub Upload Instructions for ScaleOps6 Platform

## Your repository is 100% ready to upload!
All 304 files are committed locally and waiting to be pushed to GitHub.

## Option 1: Create Personal Access Token (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Sign in to GitHub as anthonyST6
3. Give your token a name: "ScaleOps6 Upload"
4. Select expiration: 30 days (or your preference)

   - ✅ repo (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ workflow (optional, for GitHub Actions)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Create Repository and Push
Once you have your token, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd "c:/Users/antho/ST6 Nexus Ops/scaleops6-platform"

# Create the repository using your token
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"scaleops6-platform","description":"ScaleOps6 GTM Readiness Platform","private":false}'

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:

## Quick Troubleshooting

### If "repository not found" error:
- The repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet
- Create it manually using Option 2, Step 1

### If authentication fails:
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Ensure you're using username: anthonyST6

### If push is rejected:
- The repository might already exist with content
- Use `git push -f origin main` to force push (careful!)
