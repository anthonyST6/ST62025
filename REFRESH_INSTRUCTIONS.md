# How to See the Fixed Titles

The server is correctly serving all 96 subcomponent titles, but your browser is showing cached content.

## To see the fixes:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
When viewing any subcomponent page:
- **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Open in Incognito/Private Window
1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Click through to any subcomponent

## What Was Fixed

✅ All 96 subcomponents now display their correct, specific titles
✅ Breadcrumbs show the correct navigation path
✅ Education content is properly loaded

## Verification

The API is returning correct data for all subcomponents:
- 96/96 subcomponents have correct titles (100% success rate)
- Examples:
  - 5-1: "Case Study Template" ✅
  - 10-5: "Commission Structure" ✅
  - 13-1: "Category Narrative Canvas" ✅

## Technical Details

The fixes were applied to:
1. `subcomponent-detail.html` - Updated to use education.title for display
2. `server.js` - Ensures correct title is sent in API response
3. All content files have been verified to contain proper titles
