    title: "Problem Statement Definition",
    what: `A focused, plain-language articulation of the specific problem you solve for a clearly defined customer. This is not just a description of the industry or trend — it's a user-centered, situationally grounded pain point.`,
    why: `Startups often fail not because they can't build, but because they build something nobody truly needs. A strong problem statement helps align GTM, product, and messaging from the start.`,
    how: `
      <h4>Key Components to Include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who experiences the problem</strong> - Define your persona/segment clearly</li>
        <li><strong>When/where it arises</strong> - Identify contextual triggers</li>
        <li><strong>The negative impact</strong> - Quantify emotional, operational, or financial costs</li>
        <li><strong>Validation evidence</strong> - Include quotes or metrics that prove existence</li>
        <li><strong>Gap analysis</strong> - Explain why existing solutions aren't enough</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Best Practices:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it under 100 words for clarity</li>
        <li>Use customer language, not technical jargon</li>
        <li>Focus on one primary problem initially</li>
        <li>Test with 5+ potential customers for validation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Common Pitfalls:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Being too broad or vague</li>
        <li>Focusing on features instead of problems</li>
        <li>Assuming without validating</li>
        <li>Mixing multiple problems together</li>
