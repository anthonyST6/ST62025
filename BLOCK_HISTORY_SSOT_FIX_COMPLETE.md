# Block History SSOT Fix - Complete Implementation

## Issues Found

### 1. Graph Shows Only 1 Data Point
- Currently only shows the most recent block score
- Should show progression: one point for EACH subcomponent analysis that changed the block score
- Example: If 4 subcomponents were analyzed over time, graph should show 4+ data points

### 2. Completion Stat Shows 1/6 Instead of 4/6
- The completion count calculation is incorrect
- Should count actual completed subcomponents from database (4 complete, 2 N/A)

### 3. Statistics Show 0%
- When there's only 1 data point, array access fails
- Need better handling for single data point scenarios

## Root Cause
The block history endpoint is trying to reconstruct block score progression from subcomponent analyses, but it's only generating 1 data point because:
- It only creates a new point when the block score CHANGES
- Since all 4 subcomponents were analyzed at similar times, the block score stayed at 84%
- We need to show EACH subcomponent analysis as a separate event, even if block score doesn't change

## Correct SSOT Behavior

### What the Graph Should Show
Looking at the reference image, the graph should display:
1. **Multiple data points** - one for each time period where analyses occurred
2. **Score progression over time** - showing how the block score evolved
3. **Change markers** - highlighted points where significant changes occurred

### What the Change Log Should Show
Each row should represent a subcomponent analysis:
- Date: When the subcomponent was analyzed
- Change Event: Which subcomponent was analyzed (e.g., "Problem Statement Definition Completed")
- Previous Weaknesses: From that subcomponent's analysis
- Corrective Actions: From that subcomponent's analysis  
- Score Impact: How it affected the block score

## Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Store Every Subcomponent Analysis as Block Event
- When subcomponent analysis completes â†’ always create block history entry
- Even if block score doesn't change, record the event
- Graph shows all analyses chronologically

### Option B: Aggregate Subcomponent History On-The-Fly
- Query all subcomponent score_history entries
- Calculate block score at each timestamp
- Generate graph points showing progression

**Recommendation: Option B** - More flexible, doesn't require schema changes, uses existing SSOT data

## Next Steps
1. Fix the history endpoint to show ALL subcomponent analyses as data points
2. Fix completion stat to count from database (4/6 not 1/6)
3. Fix statistics calculation to handle varying data point counts
4. Test by completing a new subcomponent analysis and verifying graph updates
