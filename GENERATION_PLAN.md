# ScaleOps6 Platform - Systematic Generation Plan

## Overview
Generate 16 blocks with 96 subcomponents (16 × 6) using the locked Problem Statement structure as the template.

## Source Documents
1. **ScaleOps6 Deliverables.docx** - Curated content (use verbatim)
2. **ST6 Full Spectrum Operational Readiness Framework.docx** - Expert agents & scoring rubrics
3. **ScaleOps6 Block & Page Structure.docx** - Complete structure reference

## Generation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅
- [x] Lock template structure
- [x] Create component factory
- [x] Document standards

### Phase 2: Content Mapping (Current)
For each of the 96 subcomponents:

#### Required Elements Per Subcomponent:
1. **Expert Agent Configuration**
   - Name (from Framework doc)
   - Scoring dimensions (4-5 per agent)
   - Score ranges (0-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-90, 91-100)
   - Output format (Score, Pros, Cons, Suggestions, CTA)

2. **Customized Worksheet Fields**
   - 6 fields total (locked count)
   - Labels/placeholders match agent scoring criteria
   - Field types appropriate to content

3. **Scoring Engine**
   - 5 dimensions × 20 points each = 100 total
   - Dimension names from Framework doc
   - Evaluation criteria specific to subcomponent

4. **Content Integration**
   - Title and description from Deliverables doc
   - "What it is" section
   - "Why it matters" section
   - "What it should include" section
