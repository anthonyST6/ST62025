The challenge: use usage heatmaps to understand which features actually drove daily active users, not which features users said they wanted, to guide product development in hypergrowth.",
                
                approach: "Mark Zuckerberg instrumented everything: feature clicks, time spent, sharing patterns, and return visits. Created heatmaps showing News Feed drove 2x more engagement than any other feature despite user complaints. Measured feature usage by cohort, time of day, and user type. Used heatmaps to kill features with low engagement (Beacon, Gifts) and double down on high-engagement features (Photos, News Feed). Made data-driven decisions over user feedback.",
