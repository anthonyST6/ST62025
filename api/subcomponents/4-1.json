    "what": "A prototype launch is the strategic release of your minimum viable product (MVP) to a select group of early adopters to validate your solution, gather feedback, and refine your go-to-market approach before full-scale launch.",
    "why": "Launching a prototype allows you to test your assumptions, identify issues early, and build momentum with real users before investing heavily in full production. It reduces risk and increases your chances of product-market fit.",
    "how": "<h3>Step 1: Define Launch Objectives</h3><p>Set clear, measurable goals for your prototype launch including user acquisition targets, feedback metrics, and success criteria.</p><h3>Step 2: Select Early Adopters</h3><p>Identify and recruit a diverse group of early adopters who represent your target market and are willing to provide honest feedback.</p><h3>Step 3: Prepare Launch Materials</h3><p>Create onboarding documentation, support resources, and feedback collection mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>",
